|Risk Name (Value)      |Impact |Likelihood |Description |
|-----------------------|-------|-----------|------------|
|* Lack of Time (24)| 8 | 3 | There is a possiblity that we have not given ourselves enough time to complete a grading scale for the NIST guides. If we are low on time our product will end up being either incomplete or of a worse quality. |
|Mutiny (20)| 10 | 2 | Maybe we will all fight each other causing nothing to get done. |
|* Loss of Group Member (10) | 10 | 1 | A group member may have a personal issue appear or have some reason to drop the class or not participate anymore. If this occurs we will be heavily impacted, but the chance of this is low. |
|Heat death of Universe (10)| 10 | 1 | This will happen, but probably not while were doing the project |
|Freeze death of the earth (10)| 10 | 1 | This could also happen but I don't know much about the environment and really im just making up risks at this point|
