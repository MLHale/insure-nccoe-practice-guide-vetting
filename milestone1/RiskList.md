|Risk Name (Value)      |Impact |Likelihood |Description |
|-----------------------|-------|-----------|------------|
|* Limited Breadth of Testing (28)| 4 | 7 | For our grading scale we would want to make sure that we get a lot of outside opinion on whether our grading scale is accurate. We will likely not gather a large amount of outside testing, so most of the opionion on the scale will be done by us. |
|* Lack of Time (24)| 6 | 4 | There is a possiblity that we have not given ourselves enough time to complete a grading scale for the NIST guides. If we are low on time our product will end up being either incomplete or of a worse quality. |
|Risk 3 (20)| ? | ? | description |
|* Loss of Group Member (10) | 10 | 1 | A group member may have a personal issue appear or have some reason to drop the class or not participate anymore. If this occurs we will be heavily impacted, but the chance of this is low. |
