## Technical Plan

Utilizing the agile methodology, we will develop a baseline for our scale, replicate the lab solution, and then finalize the scale.

### Developing a Baseline Scale
First we will need to develop a baseline scale before we actually go through the document. By doing so, we will have a stronger idea of what we are looking for while we go through the document. Our scale will take influence from the System Usability Scale in order to create Likert scales for some of our defined sections. For our other sections, automated tools from sources like readibility.io and Grammarly will provide a scoring mechanism.

### Replicating the Lab Solution
In order to replicate the solution laid out within the lab document, we will first be required to get rackspace / hosting for our virtual machines. The University of Nebraska-Omaha's vSTEAL lab environment is a strong contender, otherwise we will use a combination of locally hosted and cloud hosting via Azure or AWS. We intend to go through the same combination of lab setups that the NIST document uses and perform all the same tests to ensure we recieve the same results.

### Finalizing the Scale
After we have finished replicating our lab document, we will use the baseline provided in our first step to grade the NIST document, making adjustments as needed to the baseline scale. Each member of our group will be the subjects of the scale. After each member grades the document, we will apply Cohen's kappa to measure the interrater reliability of our scale. If we have poor interrater reliability, we will go back and re-evalutate how we measure the metrics of the scale, in order to provide a consistent usability scale.
