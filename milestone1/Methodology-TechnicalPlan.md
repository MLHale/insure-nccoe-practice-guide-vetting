## Technical Plan

Utilizing the agile methodology, we will develop a baseline for our scale, replicate the lab solution, and then finalize the scale.

### Developing a Baseline Scale
First, we will need to develop a baseline scale before we actually go through the document. By doing this, we will have a stronger idea of what we are looking for while we go through the document. We will adapt the System Usability Scale from a systems view to a technical document view. We will modify the text of the survey questions while maintaining integrity of the scale. For our other sections, automated tools (from sources like readibility.io, Grammarly, and BETSY) will calculate scores for us. Our scale will combine scores for all of the metrics.

### Replicating the Lab Solution
In order to replicate the solution laid out within the lab document, we will first be required to get rack space/hosting for our virtual machines. The University of Nebraska-Omaha's vSTEAL lab environment is a strong contender. Otherwise, we will use a combination of locally hosted and cloud hosting via Azure or AWS. We intend to go through the same combination of lab setups that the NIST document, Volume C, uses and perform all the same tests to ensure we recieve the same results.

### Finalizing the Scale
After we have finished replicating the Volume C example, we will use the baseline scale developed in our first step to grade the NIST document and make an adjustments to the baseline scale. Each member of our group will apply the scale to the guide. After each member grades the document, we will apply Cohen's kappa to measure the interrater reliability of our scale. If we have poor interrater reliability, we will go back and re-evalutate how we measure the metrics of the scale in order to provide a consistent usability scale.
