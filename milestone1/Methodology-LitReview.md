The NCCoE produces practice guides (NIST SP 1800 series) in an effort to increase adoption of NIST standards and cybersecurity technologies. Each guide consists of three volumes. Volume A is a high level executive summary. Volume B contains rationale for adopting the method described and functional evaluations. Volume C contains detailed how-to instructions on how to implement the method. Although the guides describe specific technologies, they are designed to be used with other products. The metrics utilized in this project to evaluate the guides include usability, readability, understandability, accuracy, and consistency.

ISO 9241-11 defines usability as the "Extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use."(ISO citation) Effectiveness is defined as "Accuracy and completeness with which users achieve specified goals." (ISO citation)
