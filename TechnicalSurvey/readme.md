## Technical Survey
In order to take into account varying skill levels and technical backgrounds in our grading scale, we'll have the user of the technical guide take a survey prior to using the guide in order to gain information about his or her relevant experience with the technologies utilized within the guide.
Not only will this survey give context to varying scores, but it will provide those who are looking at the grading results some feedback on those technologies with which IT professionals are most comfortable, which might inform further revisions to the guide.

### How it Works
* For each guide, a survey will need to be created that consists of:
  1. Questions that ascertain user skill level and experience with broad concepts, such as DNS, mailservers, or other networking concepts.
  2. Within each broad concept section, questions will be asked that pertain to specific technologies referenced within the guide.
  3. Finally, there will be a place in each broad concept section for the user to mention other technologies that fit within the category, but are not used within the guide.
* The questions will be asked in the following way (example): "On a scale of 1-10, 1 being beginner-level and 10 being expert-level, what is your skill level with technology X?"

### Results
* Each question's value will be added up and averaged into a 10-point relevant technical score.
