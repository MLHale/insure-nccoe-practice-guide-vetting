Consistency will be measured by examining the five sub-parts of the document within sections A, B, and C:
<ol>
  <li>Problem</li>
  <li>Solution</li>
  <li>Approach</li>
  <li>Benefits</li>
  <li>Acknowledgements</li>
</ol>
The following questions will be asked to the user for feedback:
<ul>
  <li>Problem:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Did all 3 sections agree on what the problem was they were trying to solve?</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Solution:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Did all 3 sections agree on the solution to the aforementioned problem?</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Approach</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Did section C specifically implement the proposed solution from sections A and B?</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Benefits</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Did section C's implementation administer the proposed benefits from section A?</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Acknowledgements</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Was credit given to all appropriate parties within each section? For example, if an acknowledgement was made in section A, was that same acknowledgement recognized in sections B and C if it was appropriate to do so?</li>
  </ol>
</ul>
A "yes" is given a score of 1 point, and a "no" is not given any points. This makes it a 5-point consistency scale with 5 being the highest.

|Category |4 |3 |2 |1 |
|---------|--|--|--|--|
|Problem  |All 3 sections are in near-perfect agreement on what the problem is to be solved. Each section provides the appropriate audience a clear picture of what they would find in the other sections. |All 3 sections are mostly in agreement on what the problem is to be solved. There may be some ambiguity in a certain section. |All 3 sections are somewhat in agreement on what the problem is to be solved. There is ambiguity present in 2 sections. |All 3 sections are not-at-all in agreement on what the problem is to be solved. The problem is extremely unclear throughout all 3 sections. |
|Solution |All 3 sections are in near-perfect agreement on what the solution is to the problem. Each section provides the appropriate audience a clear picture of what they would find in the other sections. |All 3 sections are mostly in agreement on what the solution is to the problem. There may be some ambiguity or contradictions in a certain section. |All 3 sections are somewhat in agreement on what the solution is to the problem. There is ambiguity or contradictions present in 2 sections. |All 3 sections are not-at-all in agreement on what the solution is to the problem. The solution is extremely unclear and/or contradictory throughout all 3 sections. |
|Approach |Section C specifically implemented the proposed solution from sections A and B with no deviation. |Section C generally implemented the proposed solution from sections A and B with occasional deviation. |Section C somewhat implemented the proposed solution from sections A and B with some important deviations. |Section C’s approach to solving the problem is not-at-all what is proposed in sections A and B. There are numerous deviations between sections. |
|Benefits |Section C’s implementation of the solution provided all of the benefits proposed in section A. |Section C’s implementation provided most of the benefits proposed in section A. |Section C’s implementation provided some of the benefits proposed in section A. |Section C’s implementation provided few-to-none of the benefits proposed in section A. |
|Acknowledgements |Credit was given to all appropriate parties within each section. For example, if an acknowledgement was made in section A, that same acknowledgement was recognized in sections B and C if it was appropriate to do so. |Credit was given to most of the appropriate parties within each section. |Credit was given to some of the appropriate parties within each section. |Credit was given to almost none of the appropriate parties within each section. |
