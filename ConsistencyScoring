Consistency will be measured by examining the five sub-parts of the document within sections A, B, and C:
<ol>
  <li>Problem</li>
  <li>Solution</li>
  <li>Approach</li>
  <li>Benefits</li>
  <li>Acknowledgements</li>
</ol>
The following questions will be asked to the user for feedback:
<ul>
  <li>Problem:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Did all 3 sections agree on what the problem was they were trying to solve?</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Solution:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Did all 3 sections agree on the solution to the aforementioned problem?</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Approach</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Did section C specifically implement the proposed solution from sections A and B?</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Benefits</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Did section C's implementation administer the proposed benefits from section A</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Acknowledgements</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Was credit given to all appropriate parties within each section? For example, if an acknowledgement was made in section A, was that same acknowledgement recognized in sections B and C if it was appropriate to do so?</li>
  </ol>
</ul>
A "yes" is given a score of 1 point, and a "no" is not given any points. This makes it a 5-point consistency scale with 5 being the highest.
