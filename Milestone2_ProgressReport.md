# Progress Report (26 March 2018)
## Overview
To this point, efforts have been made to complete set up of the lab environment for replicating the practice guide. Methodology for calculating the individual metrics was finalized. Calculating the readability metric has begun.

## Outcomes

* Obtained readable.io subscription
* Obtained readability score from readable.io
* Obtained Grammarly error report
* Developed questions for Practice Guide Usability Scale (PGUS)
* Developed questions for Consistency survey
* another outcome
* ...
* ...

## Hinderances
A hinderance that has occured in creating a readability score is that the current method of using Grammarly and Readable.io are more accurate when using Word documents, and not PDFs. Grammarly has had an extreme problem with finding errors when using the PDF's text as it will sometimes point out errors that aren't errors because of how the text became formatted. A solution to this would be to see if we could get the original documents used to create the PDFs from our contact at MITRE
(insert brief discussion of challenges encountered)

## Ongoing Risks
|Risk Name (Value)      |Impact |Likelihood |Changes from Milestone 1 |
|-----------------------|-------|-----------|------------|
|Limited Breadth of Testing (28)| 4 | 7 | This issue hasn't changed from the original as it will still be a problem going forward. With only 4 testers for our scale, the lack of data could end up giving incorrect results about our finished grading scale. |
|Limited Understanding (?)| ? | ? | ? |
|Failed Replication of Chosen Guide (14)| 7 | 2 | The replication of the guide still hasn't occured, but a majority of the setup has been completed. The risk for it failing stays the same, but it shouldn't end up being a major problem. |
|Lack of Time (12)| 6 | 2 | We have done a lot of work in creating the grading scale, so a lack of time should be less likely with what we have done.|
|Loss of Group Member (10) | 10 | 1 | Currently no group members have left and it is assumed that it will stay this way for the remaining month |
(address your project risks identified from Milestone 1 and update them based on your current progress, this should be a table)
